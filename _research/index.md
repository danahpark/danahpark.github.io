I use high-performance computing and rigorous mathematical theory to simulate and understand the physics of turbulent flows and try to model their effective behavior. My study has a wide range of impacts from aerospace to naval applications.

**Current research interests: turbulence analysis & modeling, machine learning and data science for scientific computing, high-performance computing**

My current research includes:
- **Data-driven understanding & modeling** of turbulence
- **High-performance computing** of complex flow systems
- Various applications from **ocean engineering to aerospace**
