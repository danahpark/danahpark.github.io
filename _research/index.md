My research mainly involves **scientific computing, especially computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**. That is, I use **high-performance computing (HPC)** tools to simulate and understand the physics of complex, turbulent flows. My research has a wide range of impacts, in aerospace as well as naval applications. I am currently expanding my interests to **machine-learning (ML)** applications for HPC and scientific simulations.

At Stanford, I work with [Prof. Ali Mani](https://manigroup.stanford.edu/) to develop new tools for analyzing/understanding complex flow systems and improving models for more effective simulations.

I also work with [Prof. Adrian Lozano Duran](https://www.adrianld.mit.edu/research) at MIT, analyzing the underlying structures and energy cascades in turbulent flows using novel data analysis algorithms.

For my undergrad, I got a B.S.E. in Naval and Ocean Engineering. I worked with [Prof. Shin Hyung Rhee](https://snutt.snu.ac.kr/) on multi-phase flows and CFD, particularly for naval applications.

See below for some of my (beautiful) simulation images. These involve over 70TB of CFD data, simulated using over 13,000,000 CPU hours.
