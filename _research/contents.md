### Macroscopic Forcing Method (MFM)

We developed a novel systematic technique called MFM which allows us to calculate the exact Reynolds-average Navier Stokes (RANS) operator and the eddy viscosity used in the turbulence model. We applied MFM to a [turbulent channel flow](/research/channel) and a [separated boundary layer flow](/research/sbl). They mimic the wall-attached flows and smooth-body separation often shown in flows around moving objects (aircraft, ships, etc.). Using MFM, we were able to identify the missing pieces in the current turbulence models and we are currently developing a new turbulence model. Also, I did some preliminary MFM-inspired turbulence modeling using [NASA 2D wall-mounted hump](/research/wmh) as part of my Boeing internship.

### Turbulence Fundamentals

It has long been studied how energy is transferred from large to small scales in turbulent flows. Understanding this phenomenon is critical and necessary for turbulence modeling. However, this energy transfer process and the formation of turbulent structures are still not fully understood. We're currently studying the time-resolved coherent structure of the energy cascade in isotropic turbulence.
This work is advised under Prof. <a href="https://www.adrianld.mit.edu/research">Adrian Lozano Duran</a>.

In addition, I am also studying how we can utilize machine learning to encode the sub-grid-scale physics of turbulence. I am currently developing a convolutional neural network algorithm to encode sub-grid-scale physics for passive scalar transport
in 3D turbulent flow.

### Multiphase Flow
During my undergraduate studies, I studied multi-phase flows and computational fluid dynamics, particularly for naval applications. I worked on implementing the water-air simulating capability to the CFD code. The newly developed code can simulate problems involving moving objects in the ocean; e.g. naval vessels, marine lives, and underwater devices, such as sensors and cameras. In addition, I worked on design optimization of the sprinkler head, combined with computational simulations of the flow around the sprinkler.
